## Description  :clipboard:
* This is a budget tracker that users can use on the go, whether with internet access or not. All additions to the tracker while offline will populate when users come back online

### User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

### Business Context

* An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.
